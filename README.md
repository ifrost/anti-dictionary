https://ifrost.github.io/anti-dictionary/

anti-dictionary is a "dictionary" with mixed up meanings:

- definitions are from the open source dictionary: https://github.com/wordset/wordset-dictionary
- it displays only ~1000 most popular words based on the list: https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt, excluding stop words as defined here: https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280
- some random words are added too every time a new dictionary is generated
- if a word has multiple definitions only random 5 definitions are used
- definitions are randomly assigned to new words preserving part of speech
- to see the original word of the definition hover over the â€» icon
- examples are created by replacing only the original word with the new word the definition is assigned to
- a new dictionary is generated every day
- the title word at the top has the same meaning as word "dictionary" before shuffling definitions
